# 🎓 Graduation Project - Earalyze  
**AI-Powered Diagnosis Assistant for Cochlear Implant Planning**

Earalyze is a smart medical assistant that helps ENT specialists during the pre-surgical planning of cochlear implants. The system uses deep learning to analyze CT scans of the middle ear, detect key anatomical landmarks, and calculate important measurements like the stapes bone angle and length — which are essential for accurate diagnosis and surgical preparation.

## 🧠 AI Model

- Based on **VGG19** convolutional neural network.
- Trained on real CT scan images.
- Predicts angle and length of stapes bone for diagnosis.
- Implemented in **Python** using **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV**.

## 📱 Mobile Application

- Built using **Flutter**.
- Integrated with **Firebase Authentication & Storage**.
- Includes user-friendly **Onboarding**, **Login**, and **Signup**.
- Features a **Chatbot assistant** for guidance.
- Calls the AI model through a backend **Flask API**.
